BONUS POINTS:
We dynamically calculate the threshold based on the image size.
We define the rule or formula to calculate the threshold based on the image size 
We provide the error message if user did not give proper image path. If user didnâ€™t  give the proper image path we provide the message.
We provide the multiple image processing the parallel we calculate the stock analysis.
Increase the project Robustness  and scalability by adding the base case.
